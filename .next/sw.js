  Push API and Notifications API

  Work together to offer a way to engage the user
    alert user of important event
    display icon and small piece of text that user can click to open your site
    can integrate action buttons so user can interact with site without needing to revisit the
     webpage

  Push messages destined to become notifications are sent from a server directly to the push
   service with the information necessary to send to the right client and wake up the correct
    service worker (Push API)

  Notifications API let's us display notifications to the user
    same mechanisms as a native app, same look and feel
    Made of:
      Invocation API
        Controls how notifications appears (styling, vibration)
      Interaction API
        Controls what happens when user engages with the notification
